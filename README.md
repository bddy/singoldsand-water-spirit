# singoldsand-water-spirit

Interactive visuals for the singoldsand festival 2018 using microsoft kinect.

## Starting the sketch

1. Install the latest version of [Processing](https://processing.org/download).
2. Open the Project and install the library `Open Kinect for Processing 1.0` by Daniel Shiffman and Thomas Sanchez.
3. Review the settings and set everything as needed.
4. Play!

## Disclaimer

**This sketch has yet only been tested on Mac OS (intel) in combination with a Kinect version 1.**

Last time it ran was also quite a while ago and a lot has changed. It may be (very) outdated. I couldn't even start it without errors on my current machine (apple silicon).

## Troubleshooting

- Using the current Version of Processing (4.0.1) i encountered the Error `NoClassDefFoundError: /com/sun/jna/Library`. [This fix](https://discourse.processing.org/t/processing-4-openkinect/32781/9) solved the issue.
- This sketch looks like it is [broken](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+m1) when run on a apple silicon machine.
